OK, thanks.  What is a good command to extract a new dataframe from an existing one based on the highest numeric value in one of its columns (for each character group in another column)?  I don't remember that from the lectures.  Thanks for the hint.

There are many approaches (some are faster than others), but if you want to make use of what you learned in the week 3 lectures, you might want to try the "split-apply-combine" approach:

(1) read the file, then subset  from the read data.frame, the desired columns  for state, hospital and outcome (say, this is df1)

(2) check invalid entries
(3) split df1 by state (say, this is stored as an object "split.df1", which is a list of data.frames by state.

(4) sort each "state data.frame" in the "data.frame list" (df.split) by outcome then by hospital (anonymous function within lapply() will be useful). Make sure oucome is numeric and hospital is character.
This tutorial on sorting data.frames may be useful:
http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/how-to-sort-data-frames-in-r.html

(5) evaluate num and get the num-th hospital from each data.frame (if you use lapply() the result will be a list of num-th hospitals per state)
(6) convert list of num-th hospital into a data.frame (you can use rbind()) and return the data.frame
